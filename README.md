# Bike-Share-Analysis-BasicPython
This project was done as a part of data analysis nanodegree a Udacity. The intent of the project is to do an analysis 
for bike share system by Motiva in Python. The entire analysis was done in Python 3 using Jupyter notebook and the results 
were also downloaded and stored in a html file. 
The html report can be read as I share my line of thought and code in that.

# Data
Data was provided to me by Udacity. It was already downloaded and only 2% of the data was filtered to make the data more manageable.
More about this is already written in the html reportin the repository.
